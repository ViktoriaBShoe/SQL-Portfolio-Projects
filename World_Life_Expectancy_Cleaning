#World Life Expectancy Project (Data Cleaning)
# Duplicated a `worldlifexpectancy_staging` table into a new table `worldlifexpectancy`

# 1. Removing Duplicates

SELECT *
FROM worldlifexpectancy
;

# Populating a new CONCAT column for 'Country' and 'Year' to identify the duplicates

SELECT Country, Year, CONCAT(Country, Year), COUNT(CONCAT(Country, Year))
FROM worldlifexpectancy
GROUP BY Country, Year, CONCAT(Country, Year)
HAVING COUNT(CONCAT(Country, Year)) > 1
;

SELECT *
FROM
(SELECT Row_ID, CONCAT(Country, Year), ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY CONCAT(Country, Year) ORDER BY CONCAT(Country, Year)) AS Row_Num
FROM worldlifexpectancy) AS Row_Table
WHERE Row_Num > 1
;

DELETE FROM worldlifexpectancy
WHERE Row_ID IN (
	SELECT Row_ID
	FROM
		(SELECT Row_ID, CONCAT(Country, Year), ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY CONCAT(Country, Year) ORDER BY CONCAT(Country, Year)) AS Row_Num
		FROM worldlifexpectancy) AS Row_Table
		WHERE Row_Num > 1
);

# 2. Checking the missing data in the 'Status' column columns

SELECT *
FROM worldlifexpectancy
WHERE Status = ''
;

SELECT DISTINCT(Status)
FROM worldlifexpectancy
WHERE Status <> ''
;

# Only 2 statuses were identified: 'Developed' and 'Developing'

SELECT DISTINCT(Country)
FROM worldlifexpectancy
WHERE Status = 'Developing'
;

# Populating the missing statuses based off the data available for other years

UPDATE worldlifexpectancy t1
JOIN worldlifexpectancy t2 
	ON t1. Country = t2.Country
SET t1.Status = 'Developing'

	ON t1. Country = t2.Country
SET t1.Status = 'Developed' 
WHERE t1.Status = ''
AND t2.Status <> ''
AND t2.Status = 'Developed'
;

# 3. Checking the missing data from the 'Life Expectancy' table

SELECT *
FROM worldlifexpectancy
WHERE Lifeexpectancy = ''
;

# The data accurately shows the life expectancy slightly increasing each year

# In this case, it makes sense to populate the average for the missing years 
# based off the previous and the following year

SELECT Country, Year, Lifeexpectancy
FROM worldlifexpectancy
;
